# JavaScript Game
A web game developed using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

- Utilizes HTML/CSS for foundational website development, incorporating Flexbox for layout.
- Leverages JavaScript's `document` object for dynamic manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling real-time updates.
- Employs asynchronous programming to ensure smooth transition between different game stages and to retain the high score across multiple game sessions.
- Implements a reset button to easily reinitialize all game values and states.
